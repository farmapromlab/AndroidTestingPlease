AndroidTestingPlease is an Android project that uses Robolectric and Espresso for testing and Gradle to build. Project uses several jars:
- espresso-1.1.jar
- testrunner-1.1.jar
- testrunner-runtime-1.1.jar
- robolectric-2.4-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 

Robolectric is added as a jar because we had to compiled Robolectric repo with one shadow added. It had to be done because of robolectric issue:
